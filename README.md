# Next.js Dashboard Project

## Learning Experience
Coming from a React and SQL background, adapting to Next.js was quite natural. The framework builds upon familiar React concepts while adding powerful server-side capabilities. The official Next.js documentation and learning resources were comprehensive and well-structured, making the learning curve manageable.
